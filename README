Railsdav (WebDAV for Ruby On Rails)
===================================

Important note: This interim commit is in no way release-quality. It mainly exists in order for me to test that I have git installed correctly! Kieran

Railsdav is a plugin which allows for custom WebDAV controllers to be added to a Ruby On Rails application to expose functionality as filesystems to WebDAV clients such as Mac OS X Finder, Windows Network Places, Dreamweaver etc.

Railsdav requires the following gems in addition to rails

* unicode (gem install unicode)
* shared-mime-info
# mimetypes (gem install mime-types)

Railsdav was created by Stuart Eccles (http://www.liverail.net/). I'd like to thank the following people for assisting with Railsdav

*   Albert Ramstedt who contributed bug fixes for a variety of code issues and helped with re-structuring the plugin
*   Alex MacCaw
*   Fabien Franzen

 add_index :webdavs, [:path], :unique => true
Lock model
